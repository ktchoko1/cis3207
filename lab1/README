Details of code are place in the respective headers.

Both timer.c and application.c were written on a 64-bit machine with Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS

How to run:
    timer.c and application.c must be in the same directory.

    compile application.c as an executable named "app"
        i.e. gcc -o app application.c

    timer.c can be compiled into any name you wish.

    If the executible of timer.c is named "timer", enter ./timer to 
    run thr program.


timer.c is easily configured to run only one app instead of two.
